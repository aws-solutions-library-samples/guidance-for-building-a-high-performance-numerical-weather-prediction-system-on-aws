In this section of the lab we’ll setup the [Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF)](https://ncar.ucar.edu/what-we-offer/models/weather-research-and-forecasting-model-wrf). The WRF model is a mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications. It is developed and maintained by by the [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu/what-we-offer/models/weather-research-and-forecasting-model-wrf).

It is easy to install with the package manager Spack.

To do so we’ve broken it down into the following steps:

* Install WRF with Spack
* Download CONUS 12km model
* Run the forecast
* Visualize results
