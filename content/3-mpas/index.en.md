In this section of the lab, we’ll setup the [Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS)](https://mpas-dev.github.io/). The MPAS model is a mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications. Like the WRF model, it is developed and maintained by the [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu/what-we-offer/models/model-prediction-across-scales-mpas).

It’s easy to install with the package manager Spack.

To do so we’ve broken it down into the following steps:

* Install MPAS with Spack
* Download supercell test case
* Run the test case
* Visualize results
